Great news, two paper acceptances in the same day, ICST and TOSEM!

***

*A Formal Framework of Software Product Line Analysis* was accepted for publication in the [ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology (TOSEM)](https://dl.acm.org/journal/tosem). In this paper, we generalize our prior work on reliability analysis of software product lines to consider arbitrary analysis. We provide a framework that was specified and proved using the PVS theorem prover.  

Moreover, *Demystifying the Challenges to Formally Specifying API Properties for Runtime Verification* was accepted for publication at the [IEEE International Conference on Software Testing, Verification and Validation (ICST 2021)](https://icst2021.icmc.usp.br/). In this paper, we assess the challenges of specifying Java API properties for the purpose of runtime verification with a minimalist specification language. The main messages of this work are that 1) it is feasible to use a simple imperative language for specifying properties without significant loss of generality; and that 2) developers are capable of writing specifications in the (programming) language they feel comfortable.
