Great news: our paper on portability issues in Python projects has been **accepted at MSR 2026**! 🎉

---

I'm excited to announce that our paper titled _"An Empirical Analysis of Portability Issues in Python Projects"_ has been accepted at the **International Conference on Mining Software Repositories (MSR 2026)**, which will be held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in April 2026.

This work, developed in collaboration with MohamadAli Farahat and my supervisor Marcelo d'Amorim, investigates portability challenges that Python projects face across different environments. Our empirical study provides valuable insights into common portability issues and their impact on software development.

I'm looking forward to presenting our findings in Rio and engaging with the research community at MSR 2026!
