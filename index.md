Hi! My name is Denini, I'm 24 years old and passionate about computing, more specifically software engineering. In 2020, I decided to embark on the research area. Between 2020 and the beginning of 2022 I did my master's degree, and as soon as I finished my master's I started a PhD (first in the selection process).

I'm currently a PhD student in Computer Science at Federal University of Pernambuco (Recife, PE - Brazil). Advised by [Prof. Dr. Marcelo dâ€™Amorim](https://cin.ufpe.br/~damorim/).

I'm interested in software engineering, programming language, testing, and software development. I'm researching in the software testing area, focused on the Android environment.
