Hi! My name is Denini, I'm 22 years old and passionate about computing, more specifically to what is connected to programming languages. In 2020, I decided to embark in the research area.

I'm currently studying for a master's degree in Computer Science at Federal University of Pernambuco (Recife, PE - Brazil). Advised by [Prof. Dr. Marcelo dâ€™Amorim](https://cin.ufpe.br/~damorim/).

I'm interested in software engineering, programming language, testing and software development. I'm researching in the software testing area, focused on the Android environment.
